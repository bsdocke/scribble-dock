=============

A JS/HTML5 drawing canvas. The goal with this project is to create an entirely client-side image manipulation experience across all HTML5-compliant browsers.
For best results, IE 10, the latest version of FireFox, or Chrome is recommended. Not tested in Safari, and currently not compliant with mobile browsers.
